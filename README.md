#XI View 2.0
####Version
I'd like to keep this called XI View, because most everyone 
from the windower community knows it as that.With that, I 
will start it as XI View 2.0 and have the title screen with
the current date that it was updated.

####Description  
XI View 2.0 is the continued work on the project to update 
FFXIs GUI to look cleaner and for status icons to be easier 
to understand at a glance, this was formerly known as 
Brandson's UI,FFXI Style or XI View from Darkshade.

####Includes  
XI View 2.0 includes updated Status Icons, Fonts,Menu icons, 
Graphic User Interface and Menu Skins for wide screen 16:9/16:10 
displays. (This still works with 4:3 monitors it's just the 
pearl/bazzar icons next to you name will be smaller.)

####Install
To install XI View download then extract the archive and copy the 
ROM folder to your FFXI directory choosing yes when prompted to 
overwrite any files.

####Thanks
Special thanks goes to Darkshade for the original XI View and what he's done over 
the last year. Kactuar, for fixing the Icon changer program to accept the new 
32x32 Icons. And Deathbringer for the ability to change the ingame fonts and cursors.

Also, thanks Shinobi and Chef James with your help and creating new custom icons! Much appreciated!

####Other
Discontinued support for French and German and 4:3 screen UI due to SE dropping support for those languages.
